Lipset discussed the nature of democracy and the role of party representation. His paper highlights the difference in understanding of democracy between sociologists and laymen. While public opinion often emphasizes the freedom of citizens to elect representatives, sociologists focus on the social processes and elites that influence these democratic systems.\n\nA sampling of eight births were recorded since star-date zero (@fig-timeline).\n\nData and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.\n\nLet $x$ denote the number of births in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of births per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of a birth in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\nBelow is a table generated from a data frame and presented via the {gt} package\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-births .cell tbl-cap='A table of *Star Wars* characters and their birth years'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nbirths_df |> \n  select(name, birth_year) |> \n  gt::gt() |> \n  gt::tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_column_labels()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{longtable}{lr}\n\\toprule\nname & birth\\_year \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nDarth Vader & 41.9 \\\\ \nLando Calrissian & 31.0 \\\\ \nAckbar & 41.0 \\\\ \nPadmé Amidala & 46.0 \\\\ \nMace Windu & 72.0 \\\\ \nPalpatine & 82.0 \\\\ \nBail Prestor Organa & 67.0 \\\\ \nDarth Maul & 54.0 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as the situation demands, more basic tables can be presented with Markdown.\n\n| Name        | Hair Color |\n|-------------|------------|\n| Adi Gallia  | none       |\n| Dormé       | brown      |\n| Zam Wessell | blonde     |\n| Taun We     | none       |\n| Jocasta Nu  | white      |\n| Shaak Ti    | none       |\n\n: Minor *Star Wars* characters and their hair color {#tbl-hair-color}\n\n@tbl-births lists the birth years of a sample of *Star Wars* characters. Meanwhile, @tbl-hair-color summarises Minor *Star Wars* characters and their hair color.\n\n![The Epsilon Eridani system](images/epsilon_eridani_system_randyfmcdonald_cc-by-nc-sa.jpg){#fig-map}\n\nEpsilon Eridani is visible from most of Earth's surface. Located at a distance 10.5 light-years (3.2 parsecs) from the Sun (@fig-map).\n\nAlso notable is the ability to perform calculations in notebooks. This means multiple computation notebooks can be used in a project. Outputs and artifacts of those notebooks, then, can be embedded in the main manuscript page, or other notebooks. Below @fig-spatial-plot is an embedded figure derived from a separate notebook file.\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/starwars_mass-height.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the relationship of mass over height for a sample of \\_Star Wars\\* characters.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n(A), Let's not forget how cool @fig-timeline is. But, (B), don't forget (A).\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
